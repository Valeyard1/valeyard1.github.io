My name is Leonardo, I'm 18 years old, I'm a Computer Science student and a Linux/FLOSS (Free/Libre and Open Source Projects) projects enthusiast. My goal in creating this website is to be able to contribute to the Linux community, in some way.

I've been a Linux user for a while, and I've learned a few things. I still have a lot to learn, and as I'm learning, I will post here.
