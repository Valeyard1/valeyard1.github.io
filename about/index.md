## About
My name is Leonardo, I'm 18 years old, I'm a Computer Science student and a Linux and FOSS (Free and Open Source Projects) projects enthusiast. My goal in creating this site is to be able to contribute to the Linux community, in some way.

I've been a Linux user for a while, and I've learned a few things. I still have a lot to learn, and as I'm learning, I will post here.
