        <h1 id="about">About</h1>
        <p>My name is Leonardo, I&#39;m 18 years old, I&#39;m a Computer Science student and a Linux and FOSS (Free and Open Source Projects) projects enthusiast. My goal in creating this site is to be able to contribute to the Linux community, in some way.</p>

        <p>I&#39;ve been a Linux user for a while, and I&#39;ve learned a few things. I still have a lot to learn, and as I&#39;m learning, I will post here.</p>
